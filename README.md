Each image result should list at least a 
<!-- * title -->
<!-- * date of capture (ideally in earth_date)   -->
<!-- * a button to “like” that image. -->
<!-- * Each image can be “liked”, and a user should be able to undo their “like” -->
<!-- * The HTML that ends up being served client-side should be accessible and semantic (MDN reference) -->


Extras
* Save likes if the user leaves or reloads the page
<!-- * Animate the “like” action (might we suggest a heart?) -->
* Add a loading state while we wait for NASA’s API to return data
* Create shareable links for each image
* Add a date-picker to be able to browse photos starting from a specific date
